pps (Packets Per Second):
Number of packets transmitted per second in a network flow.
High pps often indicates flooding behavior in DDoS attacks.

bps (Bytes Per Second):
Amount of data transmitted per second in a flow.
Abnormally high bps may indicate bandwidth exhaustion attacks.

flow_duration:
Total time duration of the network flow.
DDoS flows are often very short and repetitive.

syn_rate:
Number of TCP SYN packets per second.
High SYN rate is a strong indicator of SYN flood attacks.

ack_ratio:
Ratio of ACK packets to SYN packets.
Low ACK ratio indicates incomplete TCP handshakes (attack behavior).

ttl_deviation:
Standard deviation of IP TTL values in a flow.
Large deviation may indicate spoofed or distributed sources.

entropy:
Entropy of packet sizes within a flow.
Higher entropy suggests random, automated traffic patterns.

repetition:
Ratio indicating repeated packet sizes.
High repetition is common in bot-generated traffic.

label:
Target class label.
0 = Normal traffic
1 = DDoS attack traffic
